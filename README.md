# Creative computing in translation

>>>>>>>> INTRODUCTION 

As a creative person I have learned the language of "art", as a purely visual and aesthetic form of communication. 
However I have recently dicovered a new visual language that I didn't know exsited, through the art of creative computing. 
Two words which I never thought I would hear together have brought to light a new form of visual communication.

Through this read me file I hope you, the reader can come to a bit more of an understanding of this infant industry and hopefully learn a new language with me.
so pls ... READ ME!

>>>>>>>> CHAPTER Ⅰ: _CODE_THE_LANGUAGE_OF_COMPUTING_ 

definition: Computer coding is the use of computer programming languages to give computers and machines a set of instructions on what actions to perform. It's how humans communicate with machines. 
Some fun facts you may not have known about coding is that it boosts and strengthens your brain. It increases logical thinking of solving problems, analyzing problems, and most importnatnly increases your creativitiy!
It is also a fact that a career in comuting such as softwear engineering requires you to have a lot of creativity in your thinking and work approach, especially when it comes to coding. Crazy I know!

>>>>>>>> CHAPTER Ⅱ: _DONT_JUDGE_A_BOOK_BY_ITS_COVER_ 

Of course at first I was confilcted by the meaning of "creative computing", it made me question wether my indivisual understanding of the words "creative" and "computing" were wrong?
therefore I knew I had to re learn these words in order to fully understand the meaning of "creative computing".
beacuse for all I knew computer engineers are not creative, or are they?

Dont judge a book by it's cover, I for one can admit I am guilty of this when it comes to computing-
and like many who have bearly gone bellow surface level of the computer industry see it as awfully bland and overly complicated.

In contrary they say, "Beauty Lies In The Eyes Of The Beholder".
I love this phrase, it's something I truely belive in and from what I have learn't software engineers see a beauty in the Computer industry that others don't at first glance.

So how is Computing creative? where can we see the beauty?

The next chapter is dedicated to explaining how creativity applies to coding. 

>>>>>>>> CHAPTER Ⅲ: _GETTING_CREATIVE_WITH_CODE_

While coding rearly involves complete freedom of expression in the same way that art does, the creativity involved with coding is called technical creativity, where people create new theories, technologies or ideas.
I you are a creative/artistic person you have most likely have already used technical creativity in your practice without realizing it. Weather that's through excersing your creative thinking using spiderdiagrams or sketchbooks to record ideas. 

Examples of applying Technical creativity to coding ->
An aspect of creativity in code is figuring out how to use code to solve problems given particular constraints. Think about this puzzle for a second: Like an escape room, Imagine you're locked inside a house, and you have just a rope, a box of matches, and an egg. How can you escape? I have no idea what the answer to this puzzle is, but it certainly takes creativity to figure it out! I'm sure if you have read or watched Sherlock Holms, you know he uses a lot of creativity, often approaching clues like parts of a code he needs to solve.

Another need for creativity in coding is being able to write code that is easy for other developers to understand and maintain. Again, when one first learns to code, their focus is on getting the code to work. But as they level up, they begin to consider that code isn't only for the computer to read; at some point, other software developers will need to read and update the code as well. It takes great creative skill and communication ability to write code that humans can easily read while the computer can still properly execute it. Some refer to this kind of code as "beautiful code."

>>>>>>>> CHAPTER Ⅳ: _WHAT_IS_BEAUTIFUL_CODE?_

as creative practisioners, we use visual language all the time in the arts. 
We use a plethorer of descriptive words to describe works of art in galleries on tiny placks and in articles.
As a newcomber to coding hearing the words "beautiful code", it is intruiging that the same descritpive language is used by the computer industry to describe coding.
there is clearly a visual side to coding we are not seeing.

How can one describe veriables and data structures as Beautiful!?
How can descriptive language be used in coding termanology?
Asking myself these questions, I discovered the Stack Exchange forum where softwear engineers discussed what is "beautiful code" and what it means to them.

Here are some quotes from engineers I found intersesting-> 

“I think most programmers will agree that beautiful code demonstrates a balance between clarity and transparency, elegance, efficiency and aesthetics.
It's just a figure of speech. Beauty lies in the eyes of the beholder, and beyond that, it's all about the clarity of the instructions that you've laid down in a text file to solve a problem, and how easily you or anyone else can modify and maintain it in the future. Beyond that, how much more beauty your code exudes is entirely up to you - indentations, modular structure, complexity, efficiency simultaneously with easy readability, naming conventions,etc.” 

"Beauty has many sources. When it comes to software development, beauty is conferred by simplicity and architectural coherence, which go hand in hand with the functional precision as well as the creativity applied to solve the problem in question. Likewise, the coding style is an integral part of the code’s elegance and should not be underestimated when it comes to improving the development team’s communication."

After reading those comments how do you feel? has your perspective on coding changed yet?
From this Q and A we learned a lot about coding through the eyes of softwear enginners, it was facinating to discover a new perspective. 
Looking further through the forum I noticed a much broader use of descriptive language, where words like "Elegant" and even "cute" where used to describe code. 

>>>>>>>> CHAPTER Ⅴ: _CODINGS_SECRET_LANGUAGE_ 

Still confused?
out of all the articles I have researched on beautiful code I recommend you read this one -> https://towardsdatascience.com/beautiful-code-ad8a0c6b19

Article epilogue -> 
"Discovering this new language, Every time we write code, we are taking a non-deterministic path towards an unknown solution; one that has never been created before! It is a journey of self-discovery and an expression of our intellect. This is exactly what art is!"
We are not the kind of artists that create visual delight for others to admire. But when we love something we put beauty into it!

I found the process of discovering this new language surprisingly engadging.
The world of code has shown a new contemprary definition of what "art" means, and way to approach creativity. 
For me at least it has opened fresh eyes on the world of communication.

>>>>>>>> CHAPTER Ⅵ: _THE_CODING_DESCRIPTIVE_DICTRIOANRY_ 

Aesthetics -> are subjective and is about being easy on the eyes. It mostly comes down to style, One important consideration is to have a consistancy in your coding style. 

Ugly -> Code that changes. An example is indenting the coding style halfway through.

Cute -> When you use a creative technique out of the ordinary to accomplish a task in code, these techniques often work well on a team of one programmer. An Example, A programmer decided unilaterally to prefix his class names with C<Component>_.

Elegant -> There are many ways to implement most algorithms. Succinctness often adds elegance, but excessive succinctness can reduce clarity. Elagance is the cleverness of accomplishing something in much less code than most people would think possible, but in a way that's readable and obvious... producing a program able to solve the problem in much less code than the non-recursive version.
Example ->
1  float invSqrt(float x){
2     long i;
3     float x2, y;
4     x2 = x * 0.5F;
5     i = *(long*)&x;
6     i = 0x5f3759df - (i >> 1); 
7     y = *(float*)&i;
8     y = y*(1.5F - x2*y*y);
9     return y;
10 }
